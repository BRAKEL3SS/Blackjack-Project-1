# Blackjack-Project-1
General Assembly SEI portfolio project 1
I made a browser based blackjack game! Blackjack is a casino game that I have always loved to play, so when I needed to make a browser based game for my General Assembly project, it seemed to be the obvious choice!



## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery

The use of JQuery was instrumental to this project as it makes use of DOM element in an effective and succinct way. The biggest challenge that I had to overcome when making this porject was creating DRY code, as my initial working model had many repeating lines of code within separate functions. As the code became less repetitive, it also enabled me to find opportunities for improvement and enhanced features. The CSS utilized is rather basic, but I believe it gets to the point and is efficient for playing the game.

## Getting started
Use the following link to access the game:

### Instructions to Play
The objective is to get your hand as close as possible to a total of 21, and once you stand, hope that the dealer fails to get closer. Aces are soft 11's, meaning if an ace would cause you to bust its value will be altered to 1. Use the Hit buttona to draw another card, but be careful not to go over 21 or you bust and lose the round. Use the Stay button to stop drawing cards and end your turn.

## Next Steps
I have multiple features that I would like to implement into this game eventually and given more time:
1. Adding additional players. The ability for multiple user players to compete against the dealer would be fun functionality and a good challenge to add to the game.
2. Betting. As this is a casino game, it is commonly played where you would bet on your hand before the round starts. It would be nice to add a basic bank that the player starts with and can work their way up or down, with the game fully ending at 0 points
3. Double Down. Following along with a betting mechanic, I would like to add a double down feature. This is a part of the game where if you are confident, you double your bet and take one single card, and then end your turn hoping to beat the dealer
4. Enhanced Visuals and Audio. Once all features have been added, it would be nice to have stronger visuals such as a blackjack table asset, and an animation to show when cards are drawn/dealt which could play a sound of  card being dealt at the same time
